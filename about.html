           <strong>I used to be a pack rat,</strong>
           I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much
            </p>
            <p class="post-para">
                Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.
            </p>
            <h2 class="title-post text">How I turned things around</h2>
            <p class="post-para">
            <strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything</strong>
            I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
            </p>
            <p class="post-para">
                It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked. 
            </p>
            <h2 class="title post text">ow I live the simple life </h2>
            <p class="post-para">Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy. </p>
            <p class="post-para">
                With how much it turned my life around
                <strong> I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it,</strong>
                and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
